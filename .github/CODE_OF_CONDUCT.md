# ProdigyPNP Code of Conduct

Our goal was to improve Prodigy's security, not ruining the game for profit. We won't sell our hacks, or put ads.

Our hacks will **always** be open-source, and free to use.

---

You may ***never***:

- Sell our hacks in any way shape or form. **This includes selling hacked accounts**.
- Hide our hacks behind a paywall/subscribewall of any kind
  - This includes adfly üòê
- Claim ownership of our hacks üò†
- Modify our hacks slightly just to add your own ads ü§®

If you're gonna talk about our hacks (on YouTube or other social media platforms), please please pretty please [credit us properly](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/YOUTUBE_ATTRIBUTION.md).

It hurts our souls when skids take credit for our hacks and don't even link us.

---

Last reminder that we are **volunteers**, and do not profit from this. We do this for *fun*, not for evil. Please don't spoil our fun.
