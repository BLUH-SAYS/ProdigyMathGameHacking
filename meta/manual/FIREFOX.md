## How to hack Prodigy: Mozilla Firefox (Manual Install)

<br>

### WARNING: Sorry, but PHEx currently doesn't work on Firefox. Use a different browser for now.

<br>

1. Open **Firefox**.
2. In Firefox, enter ``about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`` in the URL bar.
4. Next to **Temporary Extensions**, you should see a button that says **Load Temporary Add-on...**.
5. [Download PHEx.zip](https://github.com/ProdigyPNP/ProdigyMathGameHacking/releases/2.2.1). Only versions 2.x.x will work, because Firefox currently does not support Manifest V3 extensions.
6. Go back to the add-on debugging page and click **Load Temporary Add-on...**.
7. Select `2.x.x-PHEx.zip`.
8. You should see a new extension called `Prodigy Hacking Extension | PHEx` in your extensions.
9. Go to [Prodigy](https://play.prodigygame.com) (``play.prodigygame.com``).
10. Log in as usual to Prodigy. REMEMBER THAT WE STILL RECCOMMEND YOU TO LOG IN WITH A SECOND ACCOUNT TO PREVENT ACCEDENTALLY CORRUPTING YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT.
11. Once you enter a world, wait 5-15 seconds.
12. In the top left corner of your screen, you should see a dropdown arrow. Click the dropdown arrow to open the hacks.
13. Congrats, you've successfully achived hacking in the Prodigy Math Game.
